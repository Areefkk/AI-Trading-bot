The main focus of this project is to create an AI powered trading bot which is completely automated. The trader bot will look at sentiment of live news events and trade appropriately according to this.

In order to create this trading bot we use alpaca-trade-api-python, which` is a python library for the [Alpaca Commission Free Trading API](https://alpaca.markets).
